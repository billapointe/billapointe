# Hey! I'm Billie 👋

## Front-End Developer | Ex-Business Manager

I build clean, responsive websites for small businesses and entrepreneurs.

Before learning to code, I spent 2 years running a coffee roasting business — managing everything from operations to marketing. Now I combine that business mindset with technical skills to create websites that actually help businesses grow.
